[Alright, Alright, Alright,](https://mcconaughey.medium.com/the-origin-story-of-alright-alright-alright-aeb442cf8fe7)

I love biographies and I love cinema, so when I found out that Matthew McConaughey had written a memoir, I immediately added it to my reading list.

_Greenlights_ is a chronological account of his life, sprinkled with thoughts, poems, and philosophies. McConaughey based it on the journals that he’s been keeping since he was 14 years old.

I liked the biographical aspects of it. It was interesting to learn about McConaughey’s journey and his adventures along the way: an exchange year in Australia, how he fell into acting, or the intensity with which he prepares for a role (he lost 20kg to portray Ron Woodroof in _Dallas Buyers Club_, for example).

The audiobook was great. McConaughey narrates it himself, with his legendary voice and Texan accent. It’s personal and funny, and feels kind of like a friend telling you about their crazy youth (except of course, this friend is a multimillionaire celebrity).

About the life philosophies, I’m not so sure. There is so much disparate advice that I often lost the thread, and none of them really hit home for me.

At the end of the day, I tend to agree with the Washington Post’s [review](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/matthew-mcconaughey-is-all-right-all-right-all-right--and-thinks-you-will-be-too/2020/10/18/1c914348-0d59-11eb-8074-0e943a91bf08_story.html):

> “Greenlights” is stuffed with vaporous, circular proverbs for would-be McConaugheys: “All Prodigals once Pharisee, All Pharisees once Prodigal,” “I am good at what I love, I don’t love all that I’m good at,” “the arrow doesn’t seek the target, the target draws the arrow,” “I was remembered by being forgotten.”

> A fortune cookie might have written much of “Greenlights,” if a fortune cookie had starred in “Interstellar.”

> _[…]_

> So, on a scale of “How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days” to “True Detective,” I figure “Greenlights” is a solid “Magic Mike” — simply structured, a little flashy, but not as insightful as it wants you to think it is.
