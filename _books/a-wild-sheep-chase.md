_A Wild Sheep Chase_ is Murakami’s third novel, and the third book in his _Trilogy of The Rat_.

I read the first two books, _Hear The Wind Sing_ and _Pinball, 1973_, in a matter of days, so I was a bit exhausted by the time I started _A Wild Sheep Chase_.

The story didn’t hook me as much as some other Murakami novels did. How much of it was because of the plot itself, and how much simply because I needed a Murakami break, I don’t know, but I dragged _A Wild Sheep Chase_ on for a few weeks.

Still, the last third of the novel captured me again, and left me with a positive impression. There is a major twist in the plot and style of the book: what starts off as an unconventional mystery novel turns into a work of magical realism, the style that Murakami would eventually become known for.

Murakami sees _A Wild Sheep Chase_ as his “real starting point” as a novelist. It’s where he found his style. The _Trilogy of The Rat_, in addition to being an excellent read, is also a testament to Murakami’s beginnings as an author.
